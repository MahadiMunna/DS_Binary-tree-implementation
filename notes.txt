tree data structure looks like tree. It follows highrachy data structure. It has root node, parent/child node, leaf node.

Array, Linkd list -> Linear DS
Tree -> Non linear DS

in Binary tree DS a node has maximum 2 child node.

Binary node structure:
1. val
2. left
3. right

there is no STL of non linear DS.

Binary tree traverse Order:
1. Depth wise
    i. Pre order(root->left->right)
    ii. Post order(left->right->root)
    iii. In order(left->root->right)
2. Level wise
